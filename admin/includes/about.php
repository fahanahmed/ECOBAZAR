							What is Lorem Ipsum?
							Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
							typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
							standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
							printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
							specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
							the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
							unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of
							Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
							with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including
							versions of Lorem Ipsum.
